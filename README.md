<h2>How it works</h2>
Our search engine scrapes websites like Craigslist to find furniture and housing based on provided budgetary information. Then, it uses artificial intelligence and natural language processing to filter through the results to provide custom recommendations based on the user's needs. To wrap it all up, the engine provides a simple search feature for those in need of work, powered by Indeed, creating a one stop shop for those who have been hit by hard times.

<h2>Why this is important</h2>
Low-income housing is an issue that has faced the American people for decades, and it continues to plague our country to this day. Local and state governments have been working endlessly to put an end to homelessness and provide housing and vital resources to the less fortunate, but it hasn't been enough. As software engineers, we decided to use our skills for good and provide a platform to make it that much easier for those in need to quickly get back on their feet.
